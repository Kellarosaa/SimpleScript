<p>This is documentation on how to setup/use this code language.</p>
<p>Option-1, set up your repo for static websites.</p> 
<p>Make a GitHub account or any other service that hosts raw files. Then make a repo with an index.html file and any name of file with the .ss format.</p> 
<p>OP-1-S-2, Go to downloads on this site then click on ".ss file maker" and input your URL then download the output file and take the code then paste it in your index.html file.</p> 
<p>Option-2, set up your repo for apps</p> 
<p>Go to downloads then download the newest version. Then go to the .ss file maker and input your ss code url for example, raw.githubusercontent.com and it gives you the file. Then download the compiler, zip or exe it doesn't matter then run the exe as admininistrator, if you don't want to run it as admin download the zip or look through the "ss-compiler.py" in the repo. Then open the "output.ss" file using the tool. now you can run your code and it can be edited from the repo or where your code url is stored.</p> 
<p>Step-2-How to Code</p> 
<p>No syntax needed just code top to bottom.</p> 
<p>Text-type the "text()" command and put your text inside of the parentheses to display it on your site.</p> 
<p>Hyperlinks-type "https://example.com" to create a blue hyperlink.</p>
<p>Button links-type "button(example=example.com)" the "example" is the button text and the "example.com" is the link to redirect to.</p>
<p>Images-type "image(image.jpg)" to display an image you have the link for.</p>
